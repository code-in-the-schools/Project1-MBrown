    <p>Born and raised in baltimore MD. I found computing as a hobby and now it has turned into a career option. I am very lucky to have something I love become a lucrative carrer. I also run track. It helps build my character and I probobly wouldnt be able to do computer science if it wasnt for said character development. Track taught me that hard work and disipline will get you what you want 100% of the time.</p>

    <h2>Trivia about me</h2>
    <li><b>    Ive been pursuing computer science since 2017</b></li>
  <li><b>    Ill be running track for university of maryland eastern shore</b></li>
    <li>    I try my best to learn anything and everything. I really love to learn<b></b></li>
   

    <p> Belive it or not, I hated computer science in the beginning. But through hard work and dedication, I ended up liking it alot. I always was facinated with computing but it took me a while to realize that this could be married with the basic principles of science: Expiriment and try again.</p>
